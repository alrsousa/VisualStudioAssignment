Visual Studio HTML Assignment Submission

Reminder: Just a reminder that the course assignments will be graded as complete / incomplete. Your instructor will provide feedback to you on each assignment submission and will continue to do so until they judge that the assignment has been satisfactorily completed. You must complete all assignments and receive an indication of successful completion from your instructor in order to have access to the Final Exam.

Take advantage of these opportunities to practice and receive feedback from your instructor. They offer the best way to develop your skills!
